Routes: remove admin. and admin/ prefixes and group that routes under the user. and user/ prefixes;
Migrations: use different approach for defining a foreign keys
Services: declare types for the args received and remove unnecessary methods;
Views: change everything from admin. to user.;
Controllers: change everything from admin. to user.;
Maybe something else
